# AltisLife-3.1.4.8-Arma3
A basic Altis Life version 3.1.4.8
Post by Ganaclar

You must just rename the folder at WhatYouWant.Altis and put it in your folder MpMissions or Missions because it's a basic Altis Life on Altis.
After if you want to change the map, you must change the .Altis to .TheNameOfYourMap and modify a few files.

If there's problems, tell me !
